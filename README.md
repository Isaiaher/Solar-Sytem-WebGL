# Solar-Sytem-WebGL
Solar System model made with WebGL and in collaboration with Justin DeMattos and Taylor Lunde for our 412 Computer Graphics course, Spring 2018.

The goal in this project was to utilize the skills we learned in our CS 412 Computer Gaphics course. We learned about WebGL and the basics on computer graphics. We utilized shaders, textures, and drawing polygons. We did rely on one materiel object for Saturn to be able to get the rings. The textures are from NASA. We ended up using a sky-sphere for the background of stars.

The soalr system is almost to scale. The orbits are ellipses even though it is hard to tell. The planets move at speeds accurately relative to one another and the Earth is even on its axis. The sun is not to scale due to the fact that it would be too large compared to everything else. Please forgive us.

## Getting Started

The code uploaded is mostly for reference and understanding on how we made the project work. If you would like to run the project, make sure you have WebGL installed and open the [link](https://www.cs.plu.edu/~scheelia/412/final/home.html) preferably in Chrome. Cick on the "Blast Off" button and blast off into space.

Once in space you will see a few different options and HUD items. The one in the upper left explains the two different views, Mouse mode and Fly mode. Mouse moder always the user to orbit the scene with the left button, track with the right, and dolly with the scroll wheel. Fly mode always the user to use the mouse and and the awsd keys to fly around as if in a video game. 

The Planet year (in) column tells the user how many years have passed for the inner planets

The Planet year (out) column tells the user how many years have passed for the outer planets

Now for the bottom HUD

The speed tells you how fast each render is compared to how fast the planets are moving in real time.

The camera allows you to change between mouse, fly, and any celestial body you want to lock onto!

The space bar resets the camera

P key pauses the scene

The checkbox puts the orbit lines on/off

Lastly, the space ship scrubber bar speeds up or down the scene!

### Prerequisites
