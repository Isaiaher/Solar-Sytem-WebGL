# Solar-Sytem-WebGL
Solar System model made with WebGL and in collaboration with Justin DeMattos and Taylor Lunde for our 412 Computer Graphics course, Spring 2018.

## Getting Started

The code uploaded is mostly for reference and understanding on how we made the project work. If you would like to run the project, make sure you have WebGL installed and open the [link](https://www.cs.plu.edu/~scheelia/412/final/home.html) preferably in Chrome. Cick on the "Blast Off" button and blast off into space.

### Prerequisites
